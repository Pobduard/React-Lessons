  Well done on completing this course! So far you have built up a fundamental understanding of how React works and how it uses components as the building blocks of apps. And now you're one step closer to your goal of becoming a developer. That's something to be proud of! But what might your next steps be?

If you choose to continue your journey with React, you might want to take another course that will build on the React knowledge and skills you gained in this one. Or, you can expand your knowledge base and take a course on a related development topic.

Just like in this course, you will do a project for the other courses too. This means that you will have another completed project for your growing portfolio which you can use to attract potential employers. That's a smart strategy! 

Again, congratulations on completing the course. You've built up some good momentum so keep at it!
