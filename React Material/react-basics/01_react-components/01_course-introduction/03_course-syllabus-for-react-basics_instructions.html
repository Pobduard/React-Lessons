  Components are one of the foundations of React. In React, everything revolves around components. You'll learn how to build components, how to structure and customize your React projects, and how to compose layouts by importing components into other components.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll learn about passing data from one component to another. You'll learn about JSX syntax in React and how to use it to structure and style your components.
