  React has some built-in hooks, such as the
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  hook, or the
  <var>
   useRef
  </var>
  hook, which you learned about earlier. However, as a React developer, you can write your own hooks. So, why would you want to write a custom hook?
 </p>
 <p>
  In essence, hooks give you a repeatable, streamlined way to deal with specific requirements in your React apps. For example, the
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  hook gives us a reliable way to deal with state updates in React components.
 </p>
 <p>
  A custom hook is simply a way to extract a piece of functionality that you can use again and again. Put differently, you can code a custom hook when you want to avoid duplication or when you do not want to build a piece of functionality from scratch across multiple React projects. By coding a custom hook, you can create a reliable and streamlined way to reuse a piece of functionality in your React apps.
 </p>
 <p>
  To understand how this works, let's explore how to build a custom hook. To put this in context, let's also code a very simple React app.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire React app is inside the App component below:
 </p>
 <pre language="javascript">import { useState } from "react"; 
 
function App() { 
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
 
  function increment() { 
    setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount + 1) 
  } 
 
  return ( 
    &lt;div&gt; 
      &lt;h1&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/h1&gt; 
      &lt;button onClick={increment}&gt;Plus 1&lt;/button&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
  ); 
} 
 
export default App; </pre>
 <p>
  This is a simple app with an
  <var>
   h1
  </var>
  heading that shows the value of the count state variable and a button with an
  <var>
   onClick
  </var>
  event-handling attribute which, when triggered, invokes the
  <var>
   increment()
  </var>
  function.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hook will be simple too. It will console log a variable's value whenever it gets updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember that the proper way to handle
  <var>
   console.log()
  </var>
  invocations is to use the
  <var>
   useEffect
  </var>
  hook.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this means that my custom hook will:
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li aria-level="1" aria-posinset="1">
   <p>
    Need to use the
    <var>
     useEffect
    </var>
    hook and
   </p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1" aria-posinset="2">
   <p>
    Be a separate file that you'll then use in the App component.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>

   How to name a custom hook
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  A custom hook needs to have a name that begins with use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the hook in this example will be used to log values to the console, let’s name the hook
  <var>
   useConsoleLog
  </var>
  .
 </p>
 <h3 level="3" variant="h3bold">
  <strong>
   Coding a custom hook
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Now's the time to explore how to code the custom hook.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, you’ll add it as a separate file, which you can name
  <var>
   useConsoleLog.js
  </var>
  , and add it to the root of the
  <var>
   src
  </var>
  folder, in the same place where the App.js component is located.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the code of the useConsoleLog.js file:
 </p>
 <pre language="javascript">import { useEffect } from "react";

function useConsoleLog(varName) {
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    console.log(varName);
  }, [varName]);
}

export default useConsoleLog;</pre>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Using a custom hook
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  Now that the custom hook has been coded, you can use it in any component in your app.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the app in the example only has a single component, named App, you can use it to update this component.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <var>
   useConsoleLog
  </var>
  hook can be imported as follows:
 </p>
 <p>
  <var>
   import useConsoleLog from "./useConsoleLog";
  </var>
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, to use it, under the state-setting code, I'll just add the following line of code:
 </p>
 <p>
  <var>
   useConsoleLog(count);
  </var>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's the completed code of the App.js file:
 </p>
 <pre language="javascript">import { useState } from "react";
import useConsoleLog from "./useConsoleLog";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useConsoleLog(count);

  function increment() {
    setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount + 1);
  }

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={increment}&gt;Plus 1&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;</pre>
 <p>
  This update confirms the statement made at the beginning of this reading, which is that custom hooks are a way to extract functionality that can then be reused throughout your React apps
