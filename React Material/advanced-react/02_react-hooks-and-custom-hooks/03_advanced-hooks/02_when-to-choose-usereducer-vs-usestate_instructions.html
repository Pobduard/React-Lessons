  The
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  hook is best used on less complex data.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's possible to use any kind of a data structure when working with
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  , it's better to use it with primitive data types, such as strings, numbers, or booleans.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <var>
   useReducer
  </var>
  hook is best used on more complex data, specifically, arrays or objects.
 </p>
 <p>
  While this rule is simple enough, there are situations where you might be working with a simple object and still decide to use the
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  hook.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such a decision might stem from the simple fact that working with
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  can sometimes feel easier than thinking about how the state is controlled when working with
  <var>
   useReducer
  </var>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It might help conceptualizing this dilemma as a gradual scale, on the left side of which, there is the
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  hook with primitive data types and simple use cases, such as toggling a variable on or off.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of this spectrum, there is the
  <var>
   useReducer
  </var>
  hook used to control state of large state-holding objects.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's no clear-cut point on this spectrum, at which point you would decide: "If my state object has three or more properties, I'll use the
  <var>
   useReducer
  </var>
  hook".
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes such a statement might make sense, and other times it might not.
 </p>
 <p>
  What's important to remember is to keep your code simple to understand, collaborate on, contribute to, and build from.
 </p>
 <p>
  One negative characteristic of
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  is that it often gets hard to maintain as the state gets more complex.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the flip side, a negative characteristic of
  <var>
   useReducer
  </var>
  is that it requires more prep work to begin with. There's more setup involved. However, once this setup is completed, it gets easier to extend the code based on new requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Conclusion
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You learned about the decision-making process when choosing between
  <var>
   useReducer
  </var>
  and
  <var>
   useState
  </var>
  for working with different types of data.
