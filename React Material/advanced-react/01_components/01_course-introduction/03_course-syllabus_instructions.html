  <strong>
   Module 1: Components
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this introductory module, you'll learn about React and your career opportunities. You'll also learn how to set up your coding environment so that you have as productive a learning experience as possible. The purpose of this module is to understand the what and the why behind learning React. You'll also learn about career opportunities and how to set up your coding environment for the most efficient and productive learning experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  In React, everything revolves around components. You'll learn how to efficiently render list and form components, as well as how to lift up a shared state when several components need access to the data.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of this module you will be able to:

   Module 4: Graded Assessment
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p>
  In this module, you will be assessed on the key skills covered in the course and create a project to add to your portfolio.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be provided with code snippets, and your task will be to use these, plus any of your own code to complete your developers' portfolio.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a creative project, and the goal is to use as many React concepts as possible within this portfolio. You can use component composition, code reusability, hooks, manage state, interact with an external API, create forms, lists and so on.
